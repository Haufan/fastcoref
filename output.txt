John mentioned that John wanted to visit the new museum, and his friend, Sarah thought it was a great idea. As they walked, his friend, Sarah pointed out a group of ducks by the pond. "Look at a group of ducks by the pond!" his friend, Sarah exclaimed. John laughed and took a picture of a group of ducks by the pond to show John's sister later.
